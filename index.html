          <h2>Tutorial: In Eclipse</h2>

          <article class="">
			<h4>NOTE:</h4>
			<p>This secion for the tutorial was done on the Eclipse IDE integration. To use Maven on other IDE, plase refer to <a href = "https://maven.apache.org/ide.html">Apache Maven IDE Integration</a> page for instructions.</p>
			<p> If you are using Maven directly on the terminal, see: <a href="#id-terminal"><b>Tutorial: In the Terminal</b></a> section.

            <h3>$ Download and Install</h3>
			<p>In order to use Maven on Eclipse, you will need the following:</p>
			<ul>
              <li>
                <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">
                  Java (JDK version 1.7 or greater)
                </a>
              </li>
              <li>
				<a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">
                Eclipse (Luna or newer)
				</a>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>$ Create your app</h3>
			<p><h4>Create new Maven project</h4></p>
			<p>Like other Java projects, you can either import an existing Maven project or create a new project. In this section, we are building a new Hello World project in Maven.</p>
			<p>First, click on File menu and select <code>New->Project</code>. Select <code>Maven Project</code> under Maven folder and click <code>Next</code>.</p>
			<img src="./images/new_maven.png" alt="New Maven Project" width = "400" height="350"/>

			<p>Select <b>Create a simple project</b> if you want to skip archetype selection. Otherwise, an archetype menu will pop up, in which you can choose which archetype you are using for the project. Like Java projects, you can either use the default workplace or specify the path for this project. Click on <code>Next</code> to set up names for the project.</p>
			<img src="./images/new_maven_2.png" alt="New Maven Project Setting" width = "400" height="350"/>

			<p>A Maven project has two artifacts: <code>Group Id</code>and <code>Artifact Id</code>. Group Id is the name of your company/group that identifies your project uniquely across all projects, while Artifact Id is the name of the jar without version.</p>
			<p>Maven provides users a detailed <a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-naming-conventions.html">guide for naming conventions</a>, but in this simple project we will just name <code>Group Id</code> as com.capstone.app and <code>Artifact Id</code> as maven-tut. Click <code>Finish</code> to generate a new Maven project.</p>
			<img src="./images/project_id.png" alt="New Maven Project ID" width = "400" height="350"/>

		  <p><h4>Create java class</h4></p>
		  <p>Navigate to <b>maven-tut</b> and right click on <code>src/main/java</code> under the project folder. Select <code>New</code> to create a new Java class. Name the class and click <code>Finish</code>.</p>
		<img src="./images/new_maven_naming.png" alt="New Maven Project ID" width = "400" height="350"/>

		<p><h4>Add code</h4></p>
		<p>Navigate to the Java file we just built and type code as below: </p>
		<img src="./images/code.png" alt="Code" width = "400" height="250"/>
		<p>If we are using third-party libraries (like the sample code above), we have to add the dependency in POM file before compiling and building.</p>

          <article class="">
            <h3>$ Compile your app</h3>
            <p>Compilation is one of the 23 different phases of the Maven default lifecycle.
            Other phases include validation, testing, packaging, verification, installation,
            and deployment. You can execute all of these phases at one time with Maven!
            </p>
            <p>
            Before you execute the default lifecycle which will build your package, you should
            verify your current packaging method in the POM file.
            </p>
    <pre>&lt;packaging&gt;jar&lt;/packaging&gt;</pre>
            <p>
              Viable values for packaging include jar, war, ear, and pom. The default
              is jar.
            </p>

          </article>

          <article class="">
            <h3>$ Run and test your app</h3>
            <p>
              Now that you are comfortable with the packaging method, the next step is to right
              click on the project folder and click on <code>Run As</code>. From there, select <code>Maven build</code>.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/runAs.png" alt="Maven build" width="650" height="250"/>
             <p>
               You will be directed to an Edit Configuration window. In the goals field,
               write <code>package</code> and then click on Run (You can specify additional goals
               in your POM file).
             </p>
             <img src="./images/editConfig.png" alt="Edit Configuration window" width = "450" height="200"/>
             <p>
               Once the build completes, you will find your package file in the target folder of your
               project directory.
             </p>

            <p>
              There are multiple Maven commands within the <code>Run As</code> menu selection shown earlier.
              For example, there is an option called <code>Maven clean</code> that will will remove all of the files created
              during the previous build. This is a good action to take before rebuilding your project.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, there is an option called <code>Maven test</code>. Although the build option already includes testing,
              this is a good action to take when you soley want to test without rebuilding your entire project.
            </p>
            <h4> Debugging with Log4j Plugin </h4>

             <p> The following section describes some additional information about using the Log4j Plugin.
               <br/>
               <a href="#id-pom"> Click here to skip to an overview of the POM File</a>
            </p>
              <p> Imagine that you've been working on a coding assignment for a couple of weeks, and
                the day before its due, you discover a bug! Let's assume you were lazy and didn't write any
                j-unit tests. What's the first thing you do?
              </p>
              <p> One possible course of action is to discover where your program first stopped working by adding a ton of
                print statements.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, writing regular print statements is annoying because you eventually have to comment them all out or
                delete them before you turn in your assignment. What if I told you that you could write print statements that
                could appear or disappear on command.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cue the Log4j Plugin, Apache's logging package for Java!
              </p>
              <p>
                This plugin allows to use us to write logging statements with varying levels of priority. We can also turn off
                these logging statements when they are not needed. Below are the steps to begin using this Plugin:
              </p>
              <p>
                First off, there needs to be a dependency for log4j inside the POM file. Copy the dependency below
                 into your POM file between the <code>dependencies</code> tags.
              </p>
            <pre>
  &lt;dependency&gt;
     &lt;groupId&gt; log4j &lt;/groupId&gt;
     &lt;artifactId&gt; log4j &lt;/artifactId&gt;
     &lt;version&gt; 1.2.17 &lt;/version&gt;
   &lt;/dependency&gt;</pre>
            <p>
              Next, you will need to create a new log4j properties file. Right click on the src folder of your Maven project,
               and navigate to <code>New</code> then <code>File</code>. Name your new file <code>log4j.properties</code> exactly as spelled here.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/log4jproperties.png" alt="Create the properties file"  width="400" height="350"/>
            <p>
              In your log4j.properties file, copy and paste the following code.
            </p>
           <pre>
    #Root logger option
    log4j.rootLogger = FATAL, console

    #Create appender for console
    log4j.appender.console=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
    log4j.appender.console.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
           </pre>

            <p>
          The first couple of lines are specifying what level of logs that you want to see and where you would like to see them
          outputted. NOTE: The logger will display all elements at the specified logging level and of higher priority.
            </p>
            <p>
              The lines after that will initialize the console as an appender to the logger. It is possible to
              use a file as an appender by replacing console with your file name and ConsoleAppender with FileAppender.
            </p>
      <p>
        Now, create a new class in your maven-tut src folder called log4jDemo.java or something of that nature.
        Replace the default code with the code below.
      </p>
      <pre>
  import org.apache.log4j.Logger;

  public class Log4jDemo {
      //Initialize logger
      static Logger log = Logger.getLogger(HelloWorld.class);

      public static void main(String[] args) {
          /*Declare different levels of logging messages in order of highest
          priority to lowest priority*/
          log.fatal("This is a fatal message.");
          log.error("This is an error message.");
          log.warn("This is a warning message.");
          log.info("This is an info message.");
          log.debug("This is a debug message.");
          log.trace("This is a trace message.");
      }
  }

      </pre>
      <p>
        If your run this file, you will see that only the fatal message prints. This is because you
        specified FATAL on your log4j.properties file.
      </p>
      <p>Try changing the log level on your properties file and rerunning. You will see that log messages of
        this priority level and higher are printed.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you would like to see all of the messages, use <code>ALL</code> in the properties file.
        Similarily, if you would like to see none of the messages, use <code>OFF</code> in the properties
        file.
      </p>
      <p>

              <p>
                NOTE: this section fo the tutorial was done on a Linux terminal.
                Windows users can follow along with Command Line by replacing certain
                characters with the proper Windows syntax (i.e. '/' with '\')
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to use Maven you will need the following:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">
                    Java (JDK version 1.7 or greater)
                  </a>
                </li>
                <li>
                  10MB of free disk space for installation - plus space for project builds
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                On Ubuntu-based distros you can use the <code>apt-get</code> command
                install Maven.

                <pre> sudo apt-get install maven</pre>

                If you wish to use Maven on another OS or to install from source

            <h3>$ Create Your App</h3>
              <p>
                Initializing a new Maven app from the terminal is very simple.
                Go to the directory where you would like your application to exist.
                <br/>
                Use the command below to creat your project, replacing the
                <code>groupId</code> with your company/group name and
                <code>artifactId</code> with the name of your app.
                <pre>mvn -B archetype:generate \
      -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.maven.archetypes \
      -DgroupId=com.capstone.app \
      -DartifactId=maven-tut
                </pre>
              </p>
              <p>
                After a short wait, your new Maven project now exists in a new
                directory under the project's name. Let's take a quick look at the
                directory structure.
              </p>
              <img src="./images/trm_dir-struct.png" alt="The terminal's directory structure" />
              <p>
                The two main top-level objects are the POM file (pom.xml) and the
                src directory where your code lives.
              </p>
              <p>
                The <b>POM</b> (Project Object Model) file contains all of the important
                information about your project. Descibed here can be information on
                what package type to compile to, current project version, project
                dependencies, etc. This is the biggest draw to Maven - the POM file
                provides a single point of change for your applications metadata
                and resources.
              </p>
              <aside>
                For more on the POM see
                <a href="#id-pom"><b>In Depth: POM file section</b></a>
              </aside>
              <p>
                The <b>source</b> (src) folder contains two folders: "main" and "test".
                These folders will [obviously] hold your main app code and your test
                code, respectively.
                <br>
                <br>
              </p>

            <h4>Add Code</h4>
              <p>
                Navigate to <code>maven-tut/src/main/java/com/capstone/app</code>
                here you will find a java file that contains a simple "hello world"
                function.
                <br>

                Here is where we will add our code. For this example we will be
                using a java library called Guava which contains many core functions
                used by Google's Java-based apps.

              </p>
              <p>
                Next to the main "Hello World" function I created a simple function
                called "arrayToMultimap" that takes in an array of arrays that each start
                with a string and are followed by a number of values (also strings).
                It returns a Guava Mulitmap which maps multiple values to the same
                key).
                <br>
                <br>
                You can see the finished code below to adapt to your own project.
                <br>
                <br>
                We are going to use this code to show how compiling and testing
                works in Maven - and how easy it is.

                <pre>
  package com.capstone.app;

  import java.util.Collection;
  import com.google.common.collect.Multimap;

  public class App {

    public static Multimap<String,String> arrayToMultimap (String[][] arr){
      Multimap<String,String> multimap = ArrayListMultimap.create();

      for(i = 0; i < arr.length; i++ ){
        for(j = 1; j < arr[i].length; j++ ){
          multimap.put( arr[i][0], arr[i][j] );
        }
      }
      return multimap;
    }
  }
                </pre>
                <br>
              </p>

            <h4>Add a Resource</h4>
              <p>
                Now we have code that uses an external Java library but we still
                need to download it in order for our code to take advantage of it.
                Maven makes it easy. Just add a few lines to the POM describing
                the dependency: group-id, library-name, version number.

                <pre> &lt;dependency&gt;
   &lt;groupId&gt;     com.google.guava   &lt;/groupId&gt;
   &lt;artifactId&gt;  guava   &lt;/artifactId&gt;
   &lt;version&gt;     19.0   &lt;/version&gt;
 &lt;/dependency&gt;</pre>

                When we compile (in the next section), everything will be automatically
                downloaded into our project.

                Once you satisfied with your app, go back to the terminal and navigate
                to the directory containing the POM file. In our case, it is
                <code>/maven-tut</code>. Then you can run...

                <pre> mvn compile</pre>

                This is why you decided to use Maven.
                <br>
                The compile process automatically downloads all of the dependencies
                descibed in the POM file (in our case Guava).
                Then it will compile the application classes
                and place them in <code>maven-tut/target/classes</code>
              </p>
              <p>

                <br><br>
              </p>

            <h4>Testing</h4>
              <p>
                Maven can also handle automatic unit testing (because we computer
                scientists always write and execute test code).
                Since we have already written a test for our code, go ahead and
                run the following command in the terminal:

                <pre> mvn test</pre>

                Your app will compile and run the tests placed in the test folder.
                Results from these tests will be displayed at the bottom of the terminal
                output.

            <h3>$ Make a [JAR] Package</h3>
            <p>
              Now it's time to make your app distributable!
              To do this, follow in the the fashion of the past commands.

              <pre> mvn package</pre>

              The JAR is placed in the <code>/target</code> directory.
              Remember the resources we placed in the project source earlier?
              Maven adds all of the resources in <code>$maven-tut/src/main/resources</code>
              to the generated JAR. It's that easy!
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>
              You can go ahead and install from your JAR with <code>mvn install</code>
