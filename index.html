          <article class="">
			<h4>NOTE:</h4>
			<p>This secion for the tutorial was done on the Eclipse IDE integration. To use Maven on other IDE, plase refer to <a href = "https://maven.apache.org/ide.html">Apache Maven IDE Integration</a> page for instructions.</p>
			<p> If you are using Maven directly on the terminal, see: <a href="#id-terminal"><b>Tutorial: In the Terminal</b></a> section.

            <h3>$ Download and Install</h3>
			<p>In order to use Maven on Eclipse, you will need the following:</p>
			<ul>
              <li>
                <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">
                  Java (JDK version 1.7 or greater)

          <article class="">
            <h3>$ Compile your app</h3>
            <p>Compilation is one of the numerous phases of the Maven default
            lifecycle. This single lifecycle is composed of 23 different phases
            including validation, compilation, testing, packaging, verification, installation,
            and deployment. You can execute all of these phases at one time with Maven!
            </p>
            <p>
            Before you execute the default lifecycle which will build your package, you should
            verify your current packaging method in the POM file.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/pkg.png" alt="The package element" width = "350" height="60"/>
            <p>
              Viable values for packaging include jar, war, ear, and pom. The default
              is jar.
            </p>

          </article>

          <article class="">
            <h3>$ Run and test your app</h3>
            <p>
              Now that you are comfortable with the packaging method, the next step is to right
              click on the project folder and click on <code>Run As</code>. From there, select <code>Maven build</code>.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/runAs.png" alt="Maven build" width="650" height="250"/>
             <p>
               You will be directed to an Edit Configuration window. In the goals field,
               write <code>package</code> and then click on Run (You can specify additional goals
               in your POM file).
             </p>
             <img src="./images/editConfig.png" alt="Edit Configuration window" width = "450" height="200"/>
             <p>
               Once the build completes, you will find your package file in the target folder of your
               project directory.
             </p>

            <p>
              There are multiple Maven commands within the <code>Run As</code> menu selection shown earlier.
              For example, there is an option called <code>Maven clean</code> that will will remove all of the files created
              during the previous build. This is a good action to take before rebuilding your project.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, there is an option called <code>Maven test</code>. Although the build option already includes testing,
              this is a good action to take when you soley want to test without rebuilding your entire project.

            <p>
              NOTE: this section fo the tutorial was done on a Linux terminal.
              Windows users can follow along with Command Line by replacing certain
              characters with the proper Windows syntax (i.e. '/' with '\')
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to use Maven you will need the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">
                  Java (JDK version 1.7 or greater)
                </a>
              </li>
              <li>
                10MB of free disk space for installation - plus space for project builds
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              On Ubuntu-based distros you can use the <code>apt-get</code> command
              install Maven.
              <pre>sudo apt-get install maven</pre>
              If you wish to use Maven on another OS or to install from source
              consult the <a href="https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi#Installation">
              installation instuctions</a> from the Maven project site.

            <h3>$ Create your app</h3>
            <p>
              Initializing a new Maven app from the terminal is very simple.
              Go to the directory where you would like your application to exist.
              <br/>
              Use the command below to creat your project, replacing the
              <code>groupId</code> with your company/group name and
              <code>artifactId</code> with the name of your app.
              <pre>mvn -B archetype:generate \
      -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.maven.archetypes \
      -DgroupId=com.capstone.app \
      -DartifactId=maven-tut
              </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
              After a short wait, your new Maven project now exists in a new
              directory under the project's name. Let's take a quick look at the
              directory structure.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/trm_dir-struct.png" alt="The terminal's directory structure" />
            <p>
              The two main top-level objects are the POM file (pom.xml) and the
              src directory where your code lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <b>POM</b> (Project Object Model) file contains all of the important
              information about your project. Descibed here can be information on
              what package type to compile to, current project version, project
              dependencies, etc.
            </p>
            <aside>
              For more on the POM see
              <a href="#id-pom"><b>In Depth: POM file section</b></a>
            </aside>
            <p>
              The <b>source</b> (src) folder contains two folders: "main" and "test".
              These folders will [obviously] hold your main app code and your test
              code, respectively.
            </p>

            <h4>"Hello, World!"</h4>

            <h3>$ Compile your app</h3>
            <p>
              Once you satisfied with your app, go back to the terminal and navigate
              to the directory containing the POM file. In our case, it is
              <code>/maven-tut</code>. Then you can run...
            </p>
            <pre>mvn compile</pre>
            <p>
              This is why you decided to use Maven.
              <br>
              The compile process automatically downloads all of the dependencies
              and plugins descibed in the POM file. It then compiles them into the
              app and packages the app into your POM-decided packaging type.
              <br>
              The compiled classes are placed into a subdirectory:
              <code>./target/classes</code>
              [[[MORE]]]

          <article>
            <h3>$ Run and test your app</h3>
            <p>
              Maven can also handle automatic unit testing (becuase we always write
              and execute test code).
              [[[WRITE EXAMPLE TEST]]]
              Once you have written your tests go back to the terminal and run...
              <pre>mvn test</pre>
              and your app will compile and run the tests placed in the test folder.
              Results from these tests will be displayed at the bottom of the terminal
              output.
